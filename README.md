# My Simple To-Do List

This is a very basic to-do list web application I made as part of my learning journey in web development.  
It’s simple, minimal, and does just what it needs to — help keep track of tasks 

## What It Does

- Lets you add tasks
- Lets you mark them as done
- Lets you delete them if you change your mind


## Built With

- *HTML* – for the structure
- *CSS* – for a little bit of style
- *Bootstrap* – for responsive design
- *JavaScript* – for making things actually work

##  What I Might Add Later

- Saving tasks even after closing the browser
- Filters to view completed or pending tasks
- Maybe even themes.
